Hey there!
We are not responsible for using any **unoffical** programs on RunCode instances!
Please read our ToS and RunCode rules before you use any **unoffical** programs on any of ApexVM products.

Actually using RunCode to host servers is allowed unless the servers takes much of our resources - then we can terminate the VM and/or disable your access to RunCode system (don't worry, your files will be left inact). Moreover, you and **only** you are responsible for actions you do on RunCode and any other services.

**For developers and ApexVM members (not owners/co-owners)**
We have the rights to review your software and if it is against our ToS - delete it from our servers. If you think your program was removed unfairly simply contact us!
